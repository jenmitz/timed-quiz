                <p>You are a knight of the round table. You're on a quest from 
                    God himself when you come across the bridgekeeper of the 
                    Bridge of Death, who stands in the way of your quest 
                    to find the holy grail. You must cross this bridge he keeps. 
                    He stands in front of you and says,
                    <br><br>
                    "<em>Stop. Who would cross the Bridge of Death must answer me these questions 
                    three, ere the other side he see.</em>"
                    <br><br>
                    You have 30 seconds to answer his questions.
                    Your final score is the amount of time left on the clock. 
                    Good luck.
