                <h1>The Bridgekeeper</h1>
                <p>You are a knight of the round table. You're on a quest from God himself when you come across the bridgekeeper of the 
                    Bridge of Death, who stands in the way of your quest to find the holy grail. You must cross this bridge he keeps. 
                    He stands in front of you and says,
                    <br><br>
                    "<em>Stop. Who would cross the Bridge of Death must answer me these questions 
                    three, ere the other side he see.</em>"
                    <br><br>
                    You have one minute to answer his questions, should you choose to continue your journey.
                    Any incorrect answers will result in a time-loss penalty of 10 seconds, and you will be thrown off of
                    the bridge at the end of the test. Your final score is determined by how much time is left on the clock,
                    and hopefully, you're still alive to appreciate it. Good luck.
